            <p>
                I'm a Software Engineer at Accelant, where I build custom apps and integrations that extend HubSpot's
                capabilities. I work with TypeScript, React, Python, and whatever tools best fit the problem at hand. My
                focus is on streamlining complex business processes and handling large-scale data migrations—sometimes
                involving millions of records.
            </p>
            <p>
                I previously worked at Apparatix, a small, Out-of-Home advertising SaaS company.

            <p>
                Whether it be software, climbing, running, or anything else, I am someone who is always learning and seeking to improve. I believe success comes from a combination of passion, discipline, and consistency, and I apply these principles in all of my endeavors.

                    GearMate is a user-to-user gear rental platform, where users can rent out their own items to others.
                    It provides a simple way for users to go on adventures, share their gear, and make new memories,
                    without having to go to large stores such as REI or Christy's Sports.

                    App store beta launch in spring / summer 2025. GearMate is built with Ruby on Rails, TypeScript,
                    ReactNative, PostgreSQL, and other various technologies.

                I am a life-long athlete and a passionate climber. I take pride in pushing myself to both my physical and mental
                limits.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a former two-time Captain of the Division I Track & Field program at the University of Connecticut,
                where I specialized in long distance running. I have a 5k personal best of 13:59 and 3k personal best of
                8:05.
            </p>
            <p>
                After college, I fell in love with climbing. Like running, I immersed myself in the process and
                progressed quickly—climbing 5.13d in just over three years. I am currently working on my first 5.14a
                project!

        <section id="writing">
            <h2>Writing</h2>
            <p>
                I enjoy journaling and writing about my experiences in technology, climbing, and life. Writing helps me process my thoughts and share knowledge with others. I have hundreds of pages of journaling from running at UConn, and I am building the same with climbing.
